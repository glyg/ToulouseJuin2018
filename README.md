# Abstract

In this talk, I will present the `tyssue` library, used to model epithelium at the cell level.

After a brief discussion of the biology, I will discuss the physical and technical aspects of modeling living mater. What physics do we need to accurately model tissues? What are the limits of current models, and which new ones should be implemented? On a computing point of view, we'll examine how scientific python can be used in a modelling context. I will give some details on our open-science and continuous integration stategies.
